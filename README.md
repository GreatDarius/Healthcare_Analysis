# Healthcare_Analysis
In this project, we will focus on healthcare. This data set is made available by MIT. It contains data about 9,026 heartbeat measurements. Each row represents a single measurement (captured on a timeline). There are a total of 80 data points (columns). This is a multiclass classification task: predict whether the measurement represents a normal heartbeat or other anomalies.
